  notes: The reflections from the window were very frustrating, and when I tried to use my polarizing filter it was worse -- the tinted film on the window turned all kinds of crazy colors. Despite these difficulties, I wanted to share this closeup view.

    Bob Power notes: "Great study bird. Why isn't this a
    Swainson's? Sub-terminal tail band too thick and
    black. Trailing edge of the wing curves down and out
    as it leaves the body. Swainson's leaves the body in
    pretty much a straight line. Flight feathers are
    dark, but not all the way through the secondaries.
    Swainson's would be darker. Hood is a fooler, but
    Swainson's hood comes down fairly far into the chest.
    Not so on this pretty little White-tailed Hawk."

    Seen both perched and flying near the convention center for five to ten minutes in broad daylight. Amazing looks.
    
    Bob says: "Dots on flight feathers probably the best field mark here, although the whitish bars near the wing tips are
    pretty good. Common doesn't show the dots and the bar
    is set further away from the wingtip."

  notes: I noticed someone digiscoping with their Swarovski spotting scope, and headed over to see if he had found something interesting. He had evidently been looking at some Phalaropes. Although they flew off as I first approached, they later returned to a much sunnier spot.

  notes: We have officially designated this sighting as our four hundredth life bird. We were talking with a Canadian fellow who said he'd been birding for twenty years but had never seen a Purple Gallinule. Within seconds, Mary and another woman spotted the bird walking out from the reeds. In remained in the open for several minutes, so everybody could admire it in the scope.

  notes: After many false alarms and mistaken identifications, I finally captured some images of Barrow's Goldeneye at Shoreline Lake in Mountain View. Most times, I'd head up there after reading other people's reports and just not find the bird at all. Other times, I'd come home with what I was sure were images of Barrow's only to be told that I had photographed Barrow's x Common Goldeneye hybrids. So, it's nice to have found the unmistakable stubby, all-orange bill on this female. It's also nice to have had my birding gurus confirm my diagnosis (Thanks, Bob). Whew. Now if I could just get a decent picture of a Sharp-shinned Hawk!

  notes: |
    I spent some time at Moss Landing
    and Zmudowski State Beach the other week, and I ran into Dave Dixon,
    who works with the State Park folks banding Snowy Plovers. When I told
    him I was interested in the Snowy's, he offered to take me to a nest
    where he'd just banded two-day-old chicks. Well, naturally I leapt at
    the chance! He not only brought me right close to the nest, but
    actually put two of the babies in the palm of my hand, where I could
    feel their warmth seeping into my hand. It was a spiritual moment.
    Those little birds were amazing.

  notes: When we finally found this guy it was after sunset, and even though he was pretty cooperative, there was very little light for photography.

    <p>This guy landed just ten feet in front of me, and held still for long enough to snap off a few shots.</p>
    
    <p>Bob Power notes: "[this bird] has that classic rectangular blocky head look of a Coop. Brown streaks indicate juvenile. Sharpy's don't raise their hackles and always look round-headed.  Streaks get blotchy or spotty as you go down the flanks, not more thickly streaked like the Sharp-shinned.  Flanks should be more contrasty (orange flanks vs. brown back) if it was a juvie sharp-shinned."</p>

  notes: John Walker spotted it with a small pair of 10X24 Nikons. He tireless scanned the rock and reported "a bird that's not a gull." Great spotting.
