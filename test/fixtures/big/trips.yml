    [five years later, Bill returns to the scene of his 1997 solo drive up to Oregon and Malheur birding trip with Steve Shunk. This time, accompanied by an eagle-eyed Mary and a new spotting scope, promises to be even better.]
    </p>
    
    <p>We awoke this morning in Kris and Steve's house outside of Sisters. They've got five acres at the end of several miles of dirt road, 30 chickens, 3 horses, a bunch of pine siskins at their feeders, and a stunning view of the three sisters mountains.</p>
    
    <p>After a scrumptious breakfast of blueberry pancakes, bacon, and farm-fresh eggs, we headed west toward Bend and the Malheur refuge, After checking into the hotel around 4pm,. we drove around and looked at some flooded agricultural fields around town. We saw some impressive breeding behavior, including two pairs of curlews going at it, and three snipes trying out all the possible couplings. We found close to seventy species during the day, and it wasn't even a full day of looking.</p>
    
    <p>We ate at a yummy thai restaurant that offers toast with it's Sate Chicken.</p>
    
    <p>Tommorow we're going to get an early start.; the big question is, will we really get up early enough on day three to get to the Sage Grouse Lek before sunrise? Oy.</p>

  notes: |
    <p><i>Two of three target birds co-operated today, and we were treated to an unexpected swirling flight of hawks. But the lasting image of this day's birding is the eyes of an owl looking down from behind a screen of leaves.  What is it about owls that makes an encounter with them seem so spiritually meaningful?</i></p>
    
    <p>Before we left California,  birder / photographer Vivek Tiwari recommended that we include The Inn at El Canelo on our agenda.  We made arrangements on Sunday by email and spent Tuesday morning birding on the El Canelo Ranch, north of Raymondville, TX.  Owner Monica Burdette met us at the door at 8:00 and led us to the #1 target bird for visitors to the Inn - the Ferruginous Pygmy Owl - within about 2 minutes of our arrival.  Monica showed us the tiny female owl, fierce as anything and quite still in her private nest tree.  We noted the owl's location and sauntered out to a palm where Barn Owls roost (though we didn't see any there today).  On the way, we met owner Ray Burdette, out working on the property, and we spotted both Hooded and Orchard Orioles.  Both Monica and Ray made sure to tell us that this is a Very Intense Year for Rattlesnakes, and we should be careful to watch where we step.  We never did see a rattler, but we sure kept our eyes open. The next hour and a half were spent photographing the pygmy owl, the bobwhites in the lawn, a few orioles, Golden-Fronted Woodpecker -- all within hollering distance of the main ranch house.  The noisy arrivals and departures of Common and Great-tailed Grackles into the "owl tree" might have drowned out the sweet, low hooting of the owl, but the intensity of looking into the eyes of this tiny, beautiful predator kept us tuned in to her calls.  After a brief appearance by the male pygmy owl, we tore ourselves away and set off to photograph Scissor-tailed Flycatchers on the ranch roads.  This involves first finding a flycatcher and then rolling up to it slowly, hoping it is busy with a bug or otherwise fails to notice the large silver object approaching at 5 miles per hour, and then shooting like crazy out the windows of the car.  Three out of every four approaches are blown when the bird flies off, usually displaying lovely, un-photographed tail plumes.  Rats.  We managed to catch a few on the fence, just enough to make the enterprise seem like a good plan.  We may change our minds upon sober reflection.  In the course of searching the wires for scissor-tails, we saw first a solo adult Harris's Hawk, then a solo juvenile, and later a juvenile and an adult perched across the road from one another - getting a few shots of each in the increasingly harsh mid-day sun.  We ran a White-tailed Hawk off a perch without getting any shots - which takes about this much time: "Stop. Stop! Stop stop stop, what the hell are you doing, stop!"</p>
    
    <p>Around noon, we left El Canelo for Edinburg, travelling by back roads as directed by our GPS, newly christened "Victoria".  Along the roads we saw construction, croplands, scissor-tails everywhere, and a large kettle of Swainson's Hawks just outside the Edinburg city limits on FM-107.  We circled back to take some flight shots. We were somewhat giddy as hawks hunted low over the field, banking past our vantage point on top of the drainage ditch.  They seemed to be attracted to this spent cabbage field by a tractor loosening the earth where some tasty rodents must live.  We saw two separate instances of hawks with prey in their beaks being pursued by a Crested Caracara - resulting in seeming success for the caracara, or at least disappointment for the Swainson's Hawk when the prey fell to the ground.  Every few minutes, the entire flight soared high into the air and repositioned to another area of the field to start over again. It was hard to tear ourselves away and move on towards the Edinbug Scenic Wetlands / World Birding Center.  Our dream was to find the Green Kingfisher, a smaller, greener relative of the Belted Kingfisher.  But the naturalist on site, Javier de Leon, reported that he has only seen the kingfisher two or three times a week since the end of February - and today was not one of those days for us.  We had to content ourselves with Least Grebes, Gull-billed Terns, close-up Great Kiskadees and Common Moorhens.  Before dinner, some of us made a brief stop at Allen Williams' yard again, where we saw -- but weren't fast enough to photograph -- White-Throated Robin and Yellow-Breasted Chat.  Wrapped up the day with take-out sandwiches from the Saigon Cafe on 10th street in McAllen - a taste of San Jose right here in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>

    <p>We took advantage of a break in the weather to introduce our friend <a href="http://knitist.typepad.com/">The Knitist </a> to the glories of birding at Charleston Slough.</p>
    
    <p>In Stevens Creek County Park, we walked from the Villa Maria picnic area uphill into Fremont Older Open Space Preserve. There, overlooking the abandoned quarry, we saw VAUX's and WHITE-THROATED SWIFT circling with NORTHERN ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOWS. All three species were flying at eye level, affording excellent views. ORANGE-CROWNED WARBLER was heard singing loudly from the bottom of the quarry. We found no dippers at the fourth bridge over Stevens Creek, where water levels were very high.</p>
    
    <p>A breeding plumage BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER was seen from the observation platform at Charleston Slough, along with 28 BLACK SKIMMERS.</p>
    
    <p>Two EARED GREBES in breeding plumage were seen from west the end of Shoreline Lake.</p>
    
    <p>McClellan Ranch yielded many cooperate feeder birds plus a male WESTERN TANAGER in the sycamores above the creek, just at the entrace to the trail. A single WOOD DUCK flew rapidly overhead. Both BULLOCK's and HOODED ORIOLES were near the Audubon office building.</p>

  notes: As usual, we were up on the hills above Stanford this morning for Easter sunrise service near the radio astronomy dish. Also, as usual, we were joined by several dozen very curious cattle who aren't usually serenaded by guitars and flutes. The dawn chorus up there was quite impressive, I'm glad there have been such extensive efforts to maintain the habitat up there.

  leader: Bob Power
  date: "2008-04-27"
  notes: "<p>by Bob Power</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>We started the day at 4 a.m. at Almaden-Quicksilver\xE2\x80\x99s McAbee Entrance.  We were soon greeted by Great Horned Owls (4) and Western Screech-owls (2).  No Common Poorwill could be coaxed to call; Bob wrote this off as a function of too many Great-horned Owls around.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>We relocated to the John Nicholas trail at Sanborn Co. Park for a change in species composition and to set us up for Oka Ponds at dawn.  This relocation paid off with Northern Saw-whet and Northern Pygmy-owl calling in the first half mile of the trail.  The dawn chorus included Black-headed Grosbeak identified by Mary, Western Tanager, Winter Wren, and Pacific-slope Flycatcher.  The hoped-for Pileated Woodpecker didn\xE2\x80\x99t get the memo, nor did Red-breasted or Pygmy-nuthatch.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Oka ponds coughed up two target species instantly with a Green Heron flying by the entrance at 7am and a Spotted Sandpiper flying across the first large pond we came to. The bonus bird was Vaux\xE2\x80\x99s Swift (2) flying in and out of a swirl of Northern Rough-winged and Cliff Swallows and picked up quickly by Bill. Unfortunately, all non-Mallard duck species have cleared out, so no Ring-necked Duck, no Common Merganser, and no other diving ducks in the main pond.  We could have turned around at the entrance gate and saved ourselves 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From Oka ponds we relocated to Stevens Creek Reservoir where Bill picked out a Common Merganser pair making their entrance from a side cove.  A brightly lit Black-crowned Night-heron gave us momentary hopes for the Osprey. It was indeed a Night-heron, and two stops at the launch ramp and several stops along the shoreline brought no Osprey and no Caspian Terns; two birds that seemed to be a given in the days and weeks leading up to our Birdathon date. Stevens Creek picnic areas and pull-outs represented a series of hits and misses. Biggest hits:  The Dipper pair was out on the rocks below their nest; Olive-sided Flycatcher calling east of the Cooley site; Western Wood-peewee calling as soon as we exited our vehicles at the Chestnut site; Western Tanager male waiting patiently for all party members to oooh and aaaaah; Well-scouted Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Mary) buzzed at us invisibly from the same patch of brush at Villa Maria as last year\xE2\x80\x99s bird. Biggest misses: No Cassin\xE2\x80\x99s Vireo, no migrating warbler movement, and Bob's staked-out Kingfisher decided not to play.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the drive down McClellan Road to McClellan Ranch a Hooded Oriole insisted we pull over before we got to the ranch. The Barn Owl was a no-show for the first time in recorded history, or at least the last couple of months that I\xE2\x80\x99ve checked. So much for home court advantage. The Oriole may have been trying to tell us something. Like the missing Osprey and Caspian Terns, the two Hooded Mergansers (the most consistent Hooded Mergansers in recorded history) caught the midnight train out of the Gates of Heaven Cemetery pond and were nowhere to be seen on Sunday.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Our goal to see a White-throated swift before we left Cupertino didn\xE2\x80\x99t pan out, so we zipped up to Page Mill at 280 and around to the Arastradero overpass. This cost us 25 minutes, but seeing swifts up close and personal has its own rewards.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The trip to Ed Levin County Park allowed for napping, snacking, jabbering and re-charging for Misery Hill. We picked up Western Kingbird (2) at Sandy Wool\xE2\x80\x99s Eucalyptus grove thanks to Jim Thomas\xE2\x80\x99s sharp eyes, and Yellow-billed Magpie, Rufous-crowned Sparrow (Mary dug this out of the mustard) and a heard-only House Wren on the trail up to the Sycamore Grove above the dog park, but Buntings, Blue Grosbeaks, and Grasshopper Sparrows eluded us.  We did stop to admire a huge moving cotton fuzzball that most members of the team believed was a Great Horned owlet.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From Sandy Wool we went straight up to Calaveras Reservoir stopping briefly at the Felter/Calaveras intersection to admire a low-gliding juvenile Golden Eagle.  That encounter made this an Eagle-packed hour as 10 minutes later we were opposite the transmission tower where an adult Bald Eagle was on the nest with mouth open and tongue out, either begging for fresh Coot or thermo-regulating; you make the call. Our \xE2\x80\x9Cgo-to\xE2\x80\x9D Rock Wren popped up at the rock field a mile south of the Bald Eagle nest.  Curtis Snyder picked out a backlit Kestrel for our first of the day as we continued on the Felter-Sierra loop.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A trip down Marsh Rd. netted a cooperative and beautiful Lark Sparrow. Two of its friends didn\xE2\x80\x99t stick around. Sierra Rd was spectacular visually, and had the added bonus of providing a singing Horned Lark (4) at the summit corral. Now it was time to hit the bay, and pond at State and Spreckels in Alviso brought us gorgeous alternate-plumage Dunlin, Semi-palmated Plover, and Eurasian-collared Dove.  </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From here we headed for the Don Edwards Environmental Education Center in Alviso, where basic and alternate-plumage Bonaparte\xE2\x80\x99s Gulls provided interesting comparisons, which Bob limited to 15 seconds each before he said \"time to move!\" Tate Snyder expertly ID\xE2\x80\x99d a small group of Northern Shoveler\xE2\x80\x99s in flight as we tried to turn California Gulls into species we hadn\xE2\x80\x99t seen yet. We ticked a Burrowing Owl on the chain-link fence just north of Jubilee Christian, executed a u-turn, violated our 3rd of 4-for-the-day local, state or national traffic codes, skipped Arzino Ranch and headed for the Marina to look for Phalaropes and pray for Rails. The Alviso Marina was a bust.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Palo Alto Duck pond and channel yielded a quick score of 10 new species for the day, including Whimbrel, Short-billed Dowitcher, and Clark\xE2\x80\x99s and Western Grebes. Charleston Slough had the targeted Cinnamon Teal and Common Moorhen, and a backlit, distant, no doubt about it, where have you been all day, White-tailed Kite. Mary pulled white rabbits out of a marsh hat by producing distant hidden American White Pelicans. At Shoreline Lake, to round out the list of targeted staked-out, no-fail birds that all punched their ticket on Saturday night, the Red-throated Loon was nowhere to be seen on Sunday, and the Black Skimmers may use the A-1 island pond for day roosting, but Sunday night they were elsewhere. Jim Thomas saved this stop with a backlit, distant, (must be a dinky scoter) Eared Grebe, and Mary insisted that Black-bellied Plover was still a possibility and right she was. The Plovers (2) were on the island where we\xE2\x80\x99d hoped for the Skimmers. Our last bird, despite the Snyder\xE2\x80\x99s trek to to look at the back side of the island for the missing Skimmers.  A noble gesture. But it\xE2\x80\x99s never over \xE2\x80\x98til it\xE2\x80\x99s over...</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At 8:03, sun has set, light is fading\xE2\x80\xA6. Medium sized, pointed winged, powered flight, carrying dinner, heading for home\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\xA6 Peregrine Falcon; 16 hours later, bird #139 makes its dramatic appearance.</p>"

They seemed to like the shadows, but by sitting patiently I got a few shots of them out in the morning sun, where their wild colors and crazy features were fully illuminated.

    FIRT NOST!* 
    
    Mary and Bill went out from 8 am to 2 pm on January 1 to get a start on the county list for 2008.  Starting in Palo Alto, we walked out to see the Clapper Rail at the Lucy Evans boardwalk, with nice looks at male and female Common Yellow-throats along the way.  At the end of the boardwalk, we found a group of Least Sandpipers climbing the grassy banks as the tide went out and Clark's Grebes in the bay. <p>Next stop, a look at the yacht harbor.  We found one Dunlin with the sandpipers across from the Lucy Evans parking lot.  A Merlin blew past at speed, spooking the smaller shorebirds. At the the duck pond and the exposed mud  yacht harbor we poked our way to 7 gull species. I'm sure there were more.  </p><p>Around 10:40 we gate-crashed some sort of January 1 community fun run to check out the golf course lakes visible from the parking lot at the end of Geng  Road.  We found single Greater White-fronted Goose among Canada Geese, but no mergansers.</p><p>By 11:30, we had made our way to Shoreline Lake, where our first bird was a Say's Phoebe on the golf course on the west side of the lake.  Scoping from the shore near the pump housing, we saw one Spotted Sandpiper fly from the near shore to the largest island.  We located 3 red-throated loons on the lake, where others have reported the same species.</p><p>Last stop of the day was McClellan Ranch, where our first sighting at 12:45 was a Sharp-shinned Hawk flying in to a high perch in the bare sycamores.  We walked the perimeter trail without seeing many birds.  The most productive area was near the junction of the trail into the garden area, where a large tree is down. Scrub jay, 2 woodpeckers, creeper, Townsend's Warbler, California Quail, Fox Sparrow and Lincoln's Sparrow were all seen here, while Red-shouldered Hawk, Belted Kingfisher and Stellar's Jay were only heard.</p>
    
    *FIRT NOST was a typo turned into jargon for users of the PLATO computer system at the University of Illinois in the late 1970's.  After the nightly system restart, the first person to post in =pad, a popular "<a href="http://thinkofit.com/plato/dwplato.htm#gnotes">group note</a>" (equivalent to a news group) would excitedly declare their posting to be the "First Note" of the day.  When typing quickly, First Note became "FIRT NOST" and became the standard way to announce your first-ness.  This is our "FIRT NOST" birding note of 2008. Bwahaha!

    <P>STEVENS CREEK COUNTY PARK</P>
    
    <P>Villa Maria -- easily found ORANGE-CROWNED WARBLER, CALIFORNIA THRASHER, BLUE-GRAY GNATCHER on
    the uphill trail above Villa Maria plus Standard oak
    woodland species in the picnic area, many by voice.</P>
    
    <P>Ranger station -- following a hot tip from Al Eisner,
    located WARBLING VIREO behind the ranger station by sound,
    turning up a TOWNSEND'S WARBLER in the same binocular view. 
    Staked out WESTERN WOOD PEWEE and BROWN CREEPER by the bridge to Baytree picnic area in time for Snipe Hunters big day team to pick up that bird for their day list. Heard but
    never saw an insistent PACIFIC-SLOPE FLYCATCHER on the upstream side of the bridge.</P>
    
    <P>STEVENS CREEK RESERVOIR</P>
    
    <P>Dam -- Hunting the shoreline for a certain sandpiper
    we'd be sent to find, we came up empty at this
    location, but had fabulous views of a two DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS showing their "crests".  One bird had black crests
    erect over both eyes - but a second individual
    showed much longer white crests.  Very silly looking, if
    you ask me.
    
    <P>Back corner -- Located the SPOTTED SANDPIPER at the back corner along with a KILLDEER.  We made several stops around the
    reservoir looking for this bird, which might have paid off on a weekday, but for our next Saturday morning visit, we
    will skip all those stops in favor of the back
    corner of the reservoir - not quite to the place where the
    creek crosses the road.
    
    <P>ED LEVIN</P>
    
    <P>Elm Picnic Area -- Last week when we arrived at Ed Levin, there was
    absolutely zero parking to be had at the Elm Picnic
    Area thanks to the Society for Creative Anacronism
    gathering in the meadow and we ended up skipping
    this stop entirely.  This week, we had the place nearly
    to ourselves. Did not locate the special goldfinch, but
    wasted a good hour figuring out the directions.
    "North fence" ??? Best birds: GOLDEN EAGLE, WILD TURKEY, BULLOCK'S ORIOLE,
    beautiful abundant YELLOW-RUMPED WARBLER, male Selasphorous hummeringbird.
    
    <p>Sandy Wool Area -- Stopped at Hang / Para glider parking to locate two
    LAWRENCE'S GOLDFINCH as described by Dean Manley.  From there, headed straight up the hill from the dog park
    following the Agua Calliente trail to the sycamore
    grove and beyond. Heard but never saw Rufous-crowned
    Sparrow on the hillside beyond the sycamores.  Heard
    and saw GRASSHOPPER SPARROW in the same area and came down the hill pleased as punch.  Big payoff was our best view of
    the GRASSHOPPER SPARROW on the way down the hill.  Sparrow was singing in the grassy field opposity the large red water tank near sunset.  Remained perched in one location for 5
    minutes and was easily seen with scope.</P>

    0700 to 0930</p>
    
    <p>On the road from San Jose to Los Banos we started seeing raptors as soon as we got south of town and off the major highways. Our first serious stop was the rest area on highway 152, which yielded the Greater Road Runner we had been looking for in Panoche on the previous day. We also had nice looks through the scope at waterfowl far below on the reservoir.</p>
    
    <p>1000 to 1100</p>
    
    <p>We stopped in Los Banos for a pit stop and then headed toward the Merced National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). We didn't even exit the McDonald's parking lot before seeing over a dozen Cattle Egrets, our second life bird of the day. We spotted quite a few raptors on power poles and other birds on fences while en route to the NWR.</p>
    
    <p>1100 to 1400</p>
    
    <p>We spotted a wonderful Great Horned Owl just as we turned into the Merced NWR on our way to the parking lot. After pausing to look over the water from the parking lot, we slowly wound our way through the auto tour route, using walkie-talkies to relay information back and forth between cars. Although we didn't see the vast flocks of geese and cranes one might hope for, we did see some excellent ducks and raptors.</p>
    
    <p>1400 to 1630</p>
    
    <p>We decided to try our luck at the nearby San Luis NWR, where another auto tour route took us right past a lovely American Bittern. Some stubborn folks tracked a high altitude soaring raptor, which turned out to be a Bald Eagle.</p>
    
    <p>1630 to 1700</p>
    
    <p>We decided to squeeze in one last stop at the San Joaquin dam, where we enjoyed the sunset and scanned our scopes across the water. A restful end to a very full day.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the day we saw some excellent mammals and farm creatures, including:
    
    <ul>
    <li>coyote - healthy and happy looking 20 feet from the car
    <li>vole - not so healthy - he was being eaten and swallowed whole by a great egret. Great show. Wish we had it on tape to watch agan and again.
    <li>cows - Cows, cows, cows
    <li>emu - just one. Must be an experiment or a pet.
    <li>sheep - several breeds intermixed, but mostly looked like eatin' sheep, not spinnin' sheep
    <li>sheepdog - you never saw a happier animal
    <li>house cat - with dark shoulders and a white breast, sitting right where we expected to find hawks. It's always funny when you're trying to turn a mammal into some specialty bird.</p>

The much sought-after Mountain Plover and Mountain Bluebird remained elusive, but we had many other excellent looks. Hawks were especially plentiful today, as were Say's Phoebes.</p>
    
    <p>Birds we didn't see but were reported by others on the trip: Wrentit, California Gull, Vesper Sparrow, Turkey Vulture, Fox Sparrow.</p>

The photographer claims that Clapper Rails are nothing but low-down double-crossin' egg stealers. The nerve. Got to compare Dowitchers and Godwits in the same scope view. Got to look at a nearby Tern for a long time, but didn't see black going down the back of its neck as the field guide demanded.

  leader: Mary, Bill, and Lori
  date: "2008-12-14"
  notes: |-
    <p>Today, Mary and I participated in one of our
    holiday traditions, the San Jose Christmas Bird Count (CBC). As you
    probably know, our job is to count every bird we see within our small
    piece of a 10mi circle drawn around the center of San Jose. We
    constitute Party #4 of the Alviso Sector. We are entrusted with a key
    to the National Wildlife Refuge. Our most important task is to ensure
    that the San Francisco Bay's population of Snowy Plovers gets into the
    CBC database for San Jose.</p>
    
    <p>The weather was pretty spectacularly bad, with temperatures in the
    40's most of the day, driving winds all afternoon, and frequent rain
    showers. The wind is particularly vexing when trying to tally up
    hundreds of ducks on a record sheet flapping in the breeze.</p>
    
    <p>In spite of all that, we had some magical moments. After an hour of
    tramping along narrow catwalks under the high tension power towers, we
    were rewarded with two seperate flocks of the aforementioned Snowy
    Plovers totaling 67 birds, more than four times as many as we've ever
    seen in our area. It turns out some nearby ponds have much higher
    water levels this year, probably pushing some birds into our count
    area. We also got to watch a Prairie Falcon and a Golden Eagle trying
    to keep their composure in the wind. We got to visit Drawbridge, a
    genuine ghost town in the middle of the bay.</p>
    
    <p>Afterwards, we retreated to Una Mas to write up the paperwork and grab
    a bite to eat. Burrito's never tasted so good.</p>

Northern Harriers, ibis, sandhill cranes and yellow rumps were already active.  Pishing pulled in a Common Yellowthroat, followed by a single Swamp Sparrow.  Rufous wings, buffy rufous sides and grey nape were clearly observed.  Mission accomplished, we moved on to check a few more fields along the road where we saw 3 loggerhead shrikes and at least 8 palm warblers - unusual for us California birders used to seeing one at a time.

    The Early Bird Gets the Prize trip was designed by RJ Adams for the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory California Fall Challenge big day contest - one of the trips for those of us who don't yet feel comfortable planning a big day.  RJ, Mary, Bill, Juana, and Michael met at 4 am in San Juan Bautista and packed it in around 8:45 pm with dinner at Dona Esther's.

On that occasion Mary had taken two Dramamines instead of one (bad, bad advice) and slept through the whole thing. This look was much better.

  notes: |-
    <p>Mary and Bill teamed up with Dick Carlson to do this trip as a fund-raiser for the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory. It is our largest single day species total ever. Here's how the day unfolded:</p>
    
    <p>4:45am Clock radio turns on. Ugh.</p>
    
    <p>4:50am Alarm clock goes off. Ugh.</p>
    
    <p>5:00am Found the list I wrote myself last night about what to do this morning, with helpful items like "feed cat" and "eat breakfast"</p>
    
    <p>5:30am On our way to Dick's house</p>
    
    <p>6:00am We're in Dick's car, headed for the coast. The new plan is to hit the coast first, then work back toward the bay side.</p>
    
    <p>6:45am In the pre-dawn overcast we spot our first species -- a Great Horned Owl posing out in the open on a telephone wire. It seems an auspicous start to the day.</p>
    
    <p>7:30am, Pigeon Point Lighthouse. A huge raft of Common Murres floats serenely as dozens of cormorants speed by. No warblers in the trees near the hostel.</p>
    
    <p>8:20am On the way to Gazos Creek we spot our first of eight or ten Red-shouldered Hawks for the day.</p>
    
    <p>9:00am, Gazos Creek Road. We've hit the warbler jackpot! These trees are teeming with chickadees, vireos, warblers. After much debate, we decide that we're seeing both Warbling and Philadelphia Vireo.</p>
    
    <p>10:00am, Ano Neuvo State Park. Dick leads us in the secret back way to a beach overlook were we are greeted by one of the largest flocks of Western and Clark's Grebes any of us can remember.</p>
    
    <p>11:00am On our way to Pescadero Beach, we pull of the road to look at a raptor, and notice a dozen Tricolored Blackbirds posing conveniently on the telephone wire directly overhead.</p>
    
    <p>11:40am Immediately upon setting up the spotting scope at Pescadero Beach, eight mergansers hove into view around a bend in the creek. We decide its lunch time.</p>
    
    <p>1:00pm We've finished lunch at Duarte's in Pescadero, and are much revived by the Cream of Artichoke Soup. We've seen over sixty species before lunch, and are feeling good about hitting our goal of one hundred species today. Before returning to Pescadero Marsh, we drive around the town itself. During a brief roadside stop, Mary and Bill see their first Pygmy Nuthatch. A local birder invites to stop by her delightful garden, where we get great looks at Say's Phoebe.</p>
    
    <p>2:30pm, Pescadero Marsh. There are only four kinds of ducks here, but we've also rounded out our list of herons and egrets.</p>
    
    <p>3:00pm Mezza Luna. Dick introduces to the famous "Mezza Luna Willows" behind the restraurant in Princeton-by-the-Sea. These trees, like the ones at Gazos Creek, are teeming with life.</p>
    
    <p>4:00pm, Pillar Point Harbor. Finally, some Terns! We add Elegant Tern and Surf Scoter to the list and decide to head back over the hills.</p>
    
    <p>5:30pm, Redwood Shores Radio Towers. Dick is right, this pond is amazing at high tide. Amongst hundreds of Godwits, Dowitchers, and Curlews, Dick shows Mary and Bill their first Red Knot outside of the Monterey Bay Aquarium aviary. We also enjoy great looks at Pectoral Sandpiper.</p>
    
    <p>6:15pm Another unlikely but crowded pond is located directly behind the Silicon Valley Athletic Club. We add American White Pelican to the list.</p>
    
    <p>7:00pm As the sunlight fades, we stop at the East Palo Alto Baylands, one of Dick's favorite bicycle destinations. We round out our list at 115 species with the distinctive calls of Clapper Rail and Sora.</p>
    
    <p>What a day!</p>

    Frank's Dump: We hustled through Frank's Dump today - 45 minutes out to the bridge and back, with a long time scoping the big pond south of the parking lot from many angles.  We managed to find four new duck species, each represented by 1 - 4 individuals: Northern Pintail, Greater Scaup, Bufflehead, and American Wigeon.  This is starting to look better for our upcoming big day.<br /><br />
    
    But the eucalyptus grove coughed up N-O-T-H-I-N-G.  House sparrows and not one other species -- until the juvenile accipiter came between us & the car.  That was a treat in the desert!<br /><br />

  notes: |-
    <p>Colusa Wildlife Refuge offered a charming driving tour of what I presume are irrigation channels, ponds, and fields of cattails. The birds were quite acclimated to cars, but flushed immediately when I got out of the car to retrieve something from the trunk. The new binoculars worked out very well. I didn't need them to see the pheasants, though -- they stood right on the road and stared at me. I saw something that looked like a Curlew dipped in coal dust, and decided it must have been some kind of Ibis, although the light wasn't good enough to see any color details.</p>
    
    <p>A short drive along the river brought me to Gray Lodge Wildlife Refuge, although the number of hunters there made the term "refuge" seem a little funny. Apparently, there's a lot of people out there who think it's fun to camp out in a muddy camping lot on a Monday night in order to put their names in a lottery to earn the right to wander around in the marsh and shoot birds. Myself, I prefer to gaze on them from the comfort of my car, although these birds were a lot more skittish, and even hiding in the car didn't stop them from running away. In addition to the plentiful ducks I expected, there was a lovely two-point white-tailed deer, and some kind of marine mammal in a pond. I heard reports from two fellow birders that the Sacramento Wildlife Refuge had lots of vultures and geese, which I didn't get to see today -- perhaps I'll stop there on the way back.</p>
    
    <p>The region containing these two refuges reminded me a lot of central Illinois. Very flat, roads running in straight lines, most of the land consumed by agriculture. Except that you'd see a flooded field with SEAGULLS sitting in it. That seemed really out of place!</p>
    
    <p>On the way back to I5, I had the distinct pleasure of crossing the Princeton Ferry -- A platform the size of a large houseboat that pulls itself across the 50 feet of the sluggish Sacramento River for a mere 50 cents. Why not a bridge? I can only assume the river isn't always so sluggish, and must vary a lot in depth. Either that or Glenn County doesn't have much of a tax base for infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p>The drive up to Weed was uneventful. I did pass by an unlit sign saying "chains required next two miles" and other sign saying "summit 3,900 feet" that reminded me that I'm _not_ in Illinois.</p>
    
    <p>Tomorrow -- a marsh just north of here on I97 that is supposed to have lots of raptors and geese and stuff.</p>

    <p>Departing from Weed, CA on I95, I had lovely views of the scenery on my way up to Butte Valley. At BV I did another driving tour, listening to the distant sounds of honking swans from across the lake. There were few other sounds, it was so quiet. On the other side of the road the buffleheads spooked easily, fluttering further down a narrow channel. On my way out of the area I drove within a few yards of a large raptor perched on the side of the road. It might have been an immature eagle of some kind, but I didn't think the beak was big enough. I'm hoping to learn more about raptors on this trip.</p>
    
    <p>I then pretty much drove straght to Sisters, stopping at the occassional gas station on I97, which is definitely a logger's highway, not a birder's highway. Steve and I ran some errands, had dinner, and sat at his apartment until late looking at his latest photographic endeavors. I'm staying at the lovely home of Dottie Yurgel, who volunteers at the chamber of commerce. She pointed out that The Tick probably doesn't have any anti-freeze and made space in her garage so the radiator might not freeze solid overnight. Winter, Bill, they have Winter here. Duh. We bought some anti-freeze, I hope I'll get to put it in the car tomorrow.</p>
    
    <p>Tomorrow's plan: Visit Bend's sewage treatment pond, then drive the McKenzie pass scenic tour in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>This morning's trip to the Bend Wastewater Treatment Plant was very rewarding. We stood quite still for a long time, overlooking a pond with hundreds of ducks. With little ambient noise, I was able to hear the sound of wind whistling through duck feathers as they swooped into a landing at high speed. I spotted a Merlin, which we later decided is a male Tiega variant. As we were packing everything into the car, Steve spotted a raptor way up high that we decided must be an immature bald eagle. Fantastic.</p>
    
    <p>This afternoon I did the McKenzie pass scenic route. The pass itself was otherworldly. Shrouded in fog, the snow covered trees stood watch over the barren, hulking mass of lava boulders. The spindliness of the trees, the absence of other humans, the fog drifting over the terrain and the utter quiet made me feel like the last person on earth. I didn't see a single mountain peek through the fog (and there should have been many), but I loved it. I hope the pictures might come out. I also stopped by some waterfalls and greeted them. The Tick rolls bravely toward it's 100,000 mile mark, currently at 99907!</p>

    <p>We had an early morning trip to the Haystack reservoir north of Bend. Steve Shunk and I were accompanied by Steven Holt,  wildlife photographer and his dog Coot. Mr. Holt and Coot car camp from a Geo Metro that has seen better days. Holt is a charming birder, knowledgeable but not overpowering. He worked at a natural history museum in Philly, curating a collection of bird photographs. I am tempted to order one of his enlargements, perhaps one of his black oystercatcher shots. Along the way to the reservoir we stopped at a river crossing, where we saw the owl sitting quietly in a tree near the river. The reservoir was very foggy and cold. Steve peered at ducks through the scope at maximum magnification, I looked through it and saw only grey. We saw some excellent raptors on power poles along the highway. We saw a dead cow lying on its side in a field, with legs and udders firmly outstretched. We saw ravens feeding on a dead deer.</p>
    
    <p>On the way home, The Tick rolled over 100,000 miles. And still going strong. Particularly with over 1/2 a gallon of new anti-freeze in its system. Spoon!</p>
    
    <p>In the afternoon, I bought wool socks and pens. In the evening I did my crossword puzzle while attending Steve's Community Feedback Forum.</p>

    <p>After more fooling around with The Tick (turns out the guy didn't fully retighten the valve at the bottom of the radiator), Steve and I finally got underway at around noon. We drove past the town of Brothers (town for sale) and stopped for lunch at  Halton Station, where they have coyote pelts for sale, a sheet listing the bail amounts for different traffic offenses, and a bumper sticker near the restroom that says "paper products are no longer available, just wipe your ass on a spotted owl." I ate a grilled chese sandwitch and watched Quincy reruns on satellite TV. The state trooper driving the late model white Camaro stopped in for hot chocolate.</p>
    
    <p>By then the terrain was already High Desert, as though I was living in a Tony Hillerman novel. It was expansive, desolate, beautiful. We did a raptor count while driving, and then started another list once we got inside the Refuge. We're spending the night in Frenchglen at a bed and breakfast run by Steve's friend. Just outside of Frenchglen we stopped at the Buena Vista scenic overlook for some experimental pictures of the (nearly) full moon peeking through the clouds and shining on the marshes. As the moon reappeared from behind the clouds, it seemed to shine as bright as the noontime sun, accompanied by a three-part invention -- the mooing of grumpy cattle, the honking of irrascible geese, and mysterious yowling of coyotes. Something (probably a deer) was walking around in the water, splashing as it went. Sillouettes of ducks crossed through the moon's reflection on the water. A beautiful evening.</p>

    <p>This morning we wandered around the Palm Springs campground and hiked up to the top of a butte, a tremendously warming exercise. As we were finishing up the sun hit the bottom of the canyon and the trees really came alive. After a hearty breakfast of pancakes, we zoomed up north and started slowly down the central patrol road, stopping frequently. We braved a very windy levy for looks at two kinds of swans. We frowned at idiots who were harrassing a great horned owl. After grabbing our snack food bag, we headed up to the top of Steen mountain, which was clearly covered with snow. We saw Snow Buntings, a life bird for Steve and a really cool find. We didn't get to the top of the mountain due to snow drifts, but we took some excellent pictures and generally had an adventure.</p>
    
    <p>At dinner I met Steve's friend Terry, who is a remarkable man. A very large, thoughtful man who has been a bar bouncer, professional trapper, policeman, professional hunter, and employee of the malheur wildlife refuge. Now he roams the west, camping and taking wildlife photographs to turn into greeting cards. I hope to get some of them.Terry is a native of Oregon, and has very strong views about government bureaucracy, cowboys, resistance to change, mosquitos, and drinking. I'm so glad I got to meet him.</p>

    <p>Our last day on the refuge started with coffe with Terry, followed by more pancakes -- this time with blueberries. We drove north on the Central Patrol Road, and I thought I saw an owl in a large tree right near the road. Just as Steve was stopping the truck we flushed an adult Bald Eagle and watched it fly off. Astounding. From the closed refuge headquarters Steve saw a white pelican amongst the far-off swans. A Stellar's Jay, dubbed the accidental resident, was still at HQ, despite not being on the official refuge bird list. I got a good long look at a Prairie Falcon while Steve was mapping out Burns's sewage ponds for a book entitled "Birding the Sewage Ponds of Oregon." I'm not making this up!</p>
    
    <p>After lunch we headed for home, and I left from Steve's house for Klamath Falls at 7:00pm. There was some excitement caused by snow on the road, but I arrived here safely. I hope to leave early tomorrow and hit the Sacramento refuge before heading home.</p>

    <p>I left Klamath Falls shrouded in fog, and stayed in fog until just across the California border when I burst into the clear just in time for a spectacular view of Mt. Shasta. After getting down into the Central Valley, I indulged in two detours. The first was to the Coleman National Fish Hatchery, which wasn't too exciting in its own right, but had some excellent birding along the way, including a huge clump of Turkey Vultures and some nice woodpeckers. The second detour was the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, which turned out to be an excellent place to see all the geese I didn't see up in Oregon. There were thousands of geese and ducks to see from the Auto Tour route, and two very large flocks of shorebirds that wheeled around in unison and landed each time right underneath the setting sun. They were probably Dowitchers, but I couldn't tell.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I saw around 100 species of birds, including 67 in the Malheur refuge. Of these, 24 were species I had never seen before. I hope to see all of them again, and to recognize them when I do. What a trip!</p>

  notes: Mary and I made a special weekend trip to the Malheur Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, lead by Steve Shunk of <a href="http://www.paradisebirding.com/sys-tmpl/door/">Paradise Birding</a>. Our group of 5 birders and two guides met at Frenchglen on Thursday evening and birded the refuge and surrounding area until Sunday noon. We had a nice drive down from the Redmond airport, watching for raptors on power poles. Most of our roadside sightings were "usual suspects," but we were thrilled to see at least 5 Prairie Falcons along the road.

    <p>Notes Mary submitted to sfbirds mailing list:</p>
    
    <p>We saw 2 very small CANADA GEESE in Lake Merced around 9 am - they were only about 1.3 to 1.5 times the length of nearby coots.  I'm bad with the sub-species, but the heads looked square rather than round, and one of the birds had a clear white neck ring nearly as tall as the base of the bill.  This looks like Aleutian to me.</p>
    
    <p>There was a LINCOLN'S SPARROW on what my friend Bob calls "the Magic Brush Pile" next to the boathouse on Merced at 10:30.</p>
    
    <p>In Golden Gate Park, we saw 3 WHITE-THROATED SPARROWs One on the north end Stowe Lake Hill at 11:30, seen by the rest of the party, but not by me, flew from Strawberry Hill to the shore.   And two by the bathrooms next to the path by North Lake - one adult and one immature, both tan stripe morph.)</p>
    
    <p>There was a female HOODED MERGANSER on the left side of the curvy brush at Middle Lake.  The bird was preening, standing on a branch, with her back to us and a clear view of her brown crest drooping over her grey nape.</p>
    
    <p>Last are a couple I think is probably not interesting.. but I don't know the score in San Francisco. Two female RING-NECKED DUCKS flew into Lake Merced around 4 pm, landing in open water between the metal boardwalk and the skeet shooting range.  They had very bright white crescents near the bill, somewhat indistinct face markings around the eye and white around the bill, just behind the tip.  We saw a single female CANVASBACK at Lake Merced around 4:15 pm.  She was with a group of Mallards and Coots in the area between the stone bridge and the metal boardwalk, near the porta-potty.</p>

  notes: |
    <p><i>In an arid landscape, water and food sources on Martin Refuge draw in the birds.  Yes, it was hot.  And humid. But we forgot to notice the heat each time we got the intense colors of a Green Jay, a Northern Cardinal or a Roadrunner in our sights.</i></p>
    
    <p>Spent the day at the Javelina section of the (private) Martin Refuge, a 40 minute drive from McAllen, TX.  Ranch owners John and Audrey Martin have restored this acreage with native plants and developed several blinds for daily use by nature photographers.  We sampled 3 different blinds, all of which were dug into the ground and allowed eye-level shots of the birds coming to ponds, seed and suet near the blinds.  The morning was focused on familiar Rio Grande Valley birds: Curve-billed and Long-billed Thrasher, Green Jay, Crested Caracara, Northern Cardinal, Pyrrhuloxia, several species of doves and Greater Roadrunner.  Our first blind in the afternoon offered a few migrants: White-eyed Vireo, Lincoln's Sparrow and Blue Grosbeak, as well as Olive Sparrow.  The final stop was a blind near a corn feeder frequented by Javelina (oh boy, are they big!) and focused on ground feeding birds like Northern Bobwhite, Scaled Quail, Common Ground-dove, White-tipped Dove, Mourning Dove, as well as many of the morning birds.  A visit from a Sharp-shinned Hawk around tea time provided a distraction when a Common Ground-dove took refuge in our blind and had to be escorted from the premises. The facilities at this refuge and the guiding services of Patty Raney made for a fabulous first day in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>

  notes: |-
    <p>Frontera - Chimney Swifts overhead before dawn start the day at Frontera Audubon.  Chasing a Yellow-breasted Chat, we circled back past a flowing stream near the entrance - a water feature designed by Allen Williams to provide shallow edges for active use by birds.  It's working! We stuck right by the stream as a Black-throated Green Warbler pair took turns bathing in the running water and dripping off in the green cover nearby.  After nearly an hour spent quite profitably outside the gate, we finally made our way in - and nearly the first birds we encountered were a fly-by Clay-colored Robin pair.  Oh, man, this is going to be good!  Within a minute, we spotted as many as 8 Broad-winged Hawks overhead.  And then we hit a slow spot along the trail - just a few Kiskadees near the dead-end trail, the incessant calls of the Chachalaca who truly seemed to be following us everywhere in the preserve, while Golden-fronted Woodpeckers appeared over and over, always in pairs. After searching fruitlessly for what sounded like an Orange-Crowned Warbler, we finally spotted Olive Sparrow singing on a tangle of brambles.  Not to worry - we found an Orange-Crowned Warbler later in the day on the other side of the property.  When we heard a high thin "seep" sound, we hustled down the trail to follow a Black-and-White Warbler from tree to tree.  Around the back fence, the elusive Blue Grosbeak was seen only by one of us.  We trotted past the wetland and pond, where a young Yellow-Crowned Night-heron fixed his baleful orange eye on us.  We had to ask for directions to the feeding station from a caretaker, who very helpfully led us to it.  From comfortable seats, we watched Chachalaca displays, House Sparrows, Common Ground-doves, Long-billed Thrasher and Buff-bellied Hummingbirds enjoy the fare. We marked the passage of time by the arrivals of Golden-Fronted Woodpeckers.  Over the feeding platforms, we spotted a Black-throated Grey Warbler waaaay back there in the tangle of vines.  As we prepared to leave the preserve, Executive Director Wayne Bartholomew provided highly useful tips for birding behind the Audubon property and for lunch at the Tea Room inside Antiques and Collectibles on the main highway through Frontera.</p>
    
    <p>Allen Williams yard - Texas zoning strikes again.  Between a funeral home and a real estate office under construction is Allen William's house and workshop. The yard is open to birders for a $10 donation.  It's not a big property, but the activity is intense, with flowing water at several stations around the yard and lots of green cover. Blue-Winged Warbler, White-Throated Robin and Summer Tanager.  At least two Northern Parulas.  What amazing work Allen has done to landscape this yard and make a haven for birds and birders.</p>
    
    <p>Parrot evening feeding - First the grackles and red-winged blackbirds.  Then a tentative visit by a whistling duck.  Finally, the flock arrives - at least 30 parrots.  15 at a time crowd into the feeding platform, most of them grabbing at peanuts with their right foot.  Do parrots have "handedness"?  50 whistling ducks line the roof of the house, watching our every move.  By sunset, everyone has moved on, except the Purple Martins coming to roost in their martin house.</p>

Other highlights included nice looks at eared and horned grebes together and hundreds of scaup flushing up from the quiet of the O'Neill Forebay.

    <p>After returning to the car for some clean, dry air, I got the sensor back in working order and found some great subjects to photograph on the pond, especially when Ashok's swans came out and put on a show. A very enjoyable morning.</p>

    <b>SUMMARY</b><br />For an Alameda County Big Day, our three person crew met up in Bob's driveway at 2:30 AM. By 2:55 we had our first bird: Great Horned Owl calling at Redwood Regional Park. At 8 pm we wrapped up with bird #128, a Common Tern at Berkeley Marina. Our first warbler of the day, found at Del Valle Regional Park, turned out to be the bird that
    followed us throughout the county -- Yellow Warbler. On reveiwing the ABA rules, we find that we can count our 3 partially seen birds for a Grand Total of 131 species or 52.610% of Alameda County.<br/><br

    <b>Site-by-site notes</b><br />Our itinerary was heavily researched and frequently rearranged during
    the four weeks between coming up with the idea to do a big day and our
    chosen date -- chosen because it was the only free day in our calendars inside the SFBBO Fall Challenge period. 
    We'll be using these notes to enter our total in the Fall Challenge contest and for
    planning our next Alameda Big Day.<br /><br />
    
    2:55 - 4:15 am - Redwood Regional Park<br />
    Much quiet listening and tape playing only turned up two owl species -
    Great Horned (between 2 and 6 individuals) and Western Screech (4
    individuals).  A slow start.<br /><br />
    
    4:45 - 5:40 Arrowhead Marsh<br />
    Walking in the back way let us look at Black-crowned Night-heron,
    Mallard, Mourning Dove and Great Egret in the dark on our way to the
    Rail Spot, where both Clapper & Virginia Rail obliged, but Sora and
    (elusive?) Black Rail did not.<br
     / ><br />
    
    6:45 - 7:00 Mines Road<br />
    A quick pullout turned up California Thrasher and Rufous-crowned
    Sparrow.  One of our biggest scouting successes was knowing where to
    go to get these dry, interior species quickly.<br / ><br
     />
    
    7:00 - 8:30 Del Valle Regional Park<br />
    A great spot for dawn - and we chose the specific stop inside the park
    based on email sent to the EBB mailing list the night before.  Our
    "species per hour" average jumped way up, as we entered Del Valle with
    21 species (that's four per hour) and left at 8:30 with 53 (slightly
    over ten per hour). Specialties of the location were : Wilson's Snipe, Red-breasted
    Sapsucker, Downy Woodpecker, Spotted Sandpiper, Osprey, Yellow-billed
    Magpie and Green Heron. <br / ><br />
    
    8:45 - 9:00 - Murietta's Well<br>
    This quick stop for a specialty bird did not go as planned. We left
    without the Eurasian
     Collared Dove, but traded that miss for a Western
    Tanager.  And Yellow Warblers.<br / ><br />
    
    9:15 - 9:30 - Owl Road<br />
    Another great scouting success - knowing where to find a Burrowing
    Owl, Say's Phoebe, Loggerhead Shrike and (possible) Golden Eagle was
    very helpful in picking up 6 species in about 15 minutes. Onward!
    
    9:55 - 10:10 - Tassajara Creek park<br />
    Reported on EBB, this park was another quick dive into known birds,
    turning up two good warblers and a House Sparrow.<br / ><br />
    
    11:00 - 1:30 pm - Frank's Dump<br>
    Eucalpytus / bushes around the parking lot had a Lincoln's Sparrow,
    Warbling Vireo, more Yellow Warblers, and a White-Crowned sparrow.<br
    / ><br />
    
    The large pond south of the parking lot obliged with a couple of duck
    species we hadn't gotten at Del Valle - Greater Scaup, Ruddy Duck, and
    Northern Pintail - along with an Eared
     Grebe.<br /><br />
    
    The long walk out to the main shorebird roost was wearing -- some of
    us were dragging a bit by this time.  But the payoff was *huge* with
    large flocks of Western Sandpiper and Black-bellied Plover harboring
    small numbers of Sanderling (10ish), Ruddy Turnstone (3), Black
    Turnstone (1), Red Knot (20?), and Surfbird (1).  Hundreds of Marbled
    Godwit scanned failed to turn into Long-billed Curlews.  On the walk
    back, we heard, but never saw, Horned Larks on top of the active trash
    heap and Bob spotted a single fly-by Whimbrel.  We probably spent more
    time than we should have trying to spot the Horned Larks, but they
    were soooooo annoying close and vocal, it was hard to resist<br /><br
    />
    
    
    2 pm - 3:30 pm Coyote Hills<br />
    The butterfly garden had a Western Woodpewee and American but not Lesser Goldfinches (a miss for the day).  An adult Cooper's Hawk landed on a pole just beyond the gardens and there wasn't much feeder action after that! Rock Wren failed to appear on our way out to the ducks overlook, but Green-winged Teal, American Wigeon, and Common Moorhen were located amongst hundreds of eclipse Northern Pintails -- and seen by Bob & Bill but missed by Mary, rats!  The arrival of a Lark Sparrow (once again, credit to Bob!) was a consolation prize.<br
    / ><br />
    
    3:50 - 4:15 - San Leandro Marina<br />
    Drove up to San Leandro and found the Pectoral Sandpiper which Bob had discovered while scouting the day before. The sandpiper was on the island breakwater, but the tide was so low at this point that the "island" was acessible to the humans, and no terns were hanging around.
    <br /><br /> 
    4:30 - 5:00 - Alameda shore<br />
    Parked near the beach at Alameda South shore, where Bob spotted two Elegant Terns heading away -- which Bill & Mary could not pick up.  Picked up Long-billed Curlew, but no Sora.  Elected to cut this stop short in order to return to the redwoods, since our "likely" list had 8 redwood species left on it.
    <br /><br /> 
    5:30 - 6:30 - Chabot observatory<br />
    Another highly successful stop brought morale back up after a mid-afternoon slump amongst the smaller animals in the expedition.  In 10 minutes, we picked up Townsend's Warbler, Pygmy Nuthatch, Dark-eyed Junco, Steller's Jay, Brown Creeper, and Hairy Woodpecker in the first 10 feet of the trail. Only Mary saw the Band-tailed Pigeon flyover, so we can't count that on the list, but another 15 minutes' work brought us Red-breasted Nuthatch and Hutton's Vireo.  A second stop for chaparral netted us a Wrentit.  Now we were at 127 species and had our eyes on 130.  We dashed back to the shore to try our luck.
    <br /><br /> 
    7:00 - 7:45 pm - Cesar Chavez Park<br />
    We headed north along the road towards Cesar Chavez park near Berkeley Marina.  There was one Clark's Grebe visible in the water -- but none of our hoped for comormants or scoters.   We did find at least one Common Tern, but were unable to scare up the Barn Owl from the kite flying park. We had to close our day with 128 species.  A more energetic team would surely have tried another stop for Pelagic Cormorant or maybe Sora back at Arrowhead, to boost the total, but we were cooked on both sides and had to call it a night.
    <br /><br /> 
    Our day ends with 128 species for the team - a perfect square -  and a feeling that we did "pretty well" for our
     first Alameda Big Day, but we want another shot!<br /><br /> 
    POSTSCRIPT:  A big day is not over until the list is discussed & retallied at length and the rules reviewed.  ABA Big Day rules allow species to be included in the Grand Total even if they are not seen by all observers.  We had five species in that category -- Elegant Tern, Black-headed Grosbeak, Common Moorhen, Violet-green Swallow and Band-tailed Pigeon -- and a review of the rules shows that these all count, not just the ones seen by a majority of ht team.  We were allowed 6 species not seen by the whole team -- so all 5 of our "partials" count. This increases our total to 131 for the trip and that's the total we will be reporting to SFBBO.<br /><br />
    
    <b>Totals:</b><br /><br />
    
    Bob Power: 126 + VIGSWA + ELETER + COMMOO = 129<br />
    Bill Walker: 126 + COMMOO = 127<br />

  leader: Lisa Myers
  date: "2007-10-06"
  notes: |
    <p>Today we went with Lisa Myers on a fundraising Big Day trip as part of the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory California Fall Challenge.</p>
    
    <p>First stop of the day was Zmudowski State Beach. This out-of-the way approach road, many birds were seen on the drive to the beach. A Virginia Rail responded to a single taped call by flying across the entire pond directly toward us, landing at our feet.</p>
    
    <p>Our sightings for Moss Landing State Beach include birds seen from the Moss Landing Marina as well as Jetty Road. The group was very excited to see six Snowy Plovers roosting quietly on the beach.</p>
    
    <p>At Moonglow Dairy, we drove in through blackbird flocks, scoped nearby ponds for shorebirds, briefly checked edges of Eucalyptus grove. Circling Golden Eagle harassed by Red-tailed Hawks and Pectoral Sandpiper were the highlights of this stop.</p>
    
    <p>Our lunch stop was the Embassay Suites hotel parking lot, where we immediately found the roosting Peregrine Falcon in the 'S' of the hotel logo. We showed it to a variety of hotel guests before moving to the lagoon.</p>
    
    <p>After lunch we drove to Jacks Peak, which was very quiet. We worked hard to get seven woodland species in return for our $20 admission fee, a pricey $3 per bird.</p>
    
    <p>The only target bird for this trip was the California Condor, so we made a beeline for the area south of Andrew Molera, stopping only to pick up Pelagic Cormorant and Black Oystercatcher on the rocky coast below highway one. South of Big Sur Station, Harold said to Lisa, "What's that?" We pulled off to investigate a large perched bird with no feathers on its head. It was clearly a Condor perched on a snag. While watching this bird, other team members found four more Condors circling the ridge line to the south. Great views were had by all.</p>
    
    <p>Last bird of the day was the Great Horned Owl on Dolan Road in near total darkness. Preliminary tally is 108 species in Monterey County. Thanks, Lisa, for an excellent day!</p>

    <p>We spent the morning with Bob and company, then split off after lunch. Before we joined the group at Drake's Beach, others reported Red-throated Loon and Elegant Tern. We had great looks at Osprey flying over the beach. Weather was sunny and pleasant with an offshore wind. It was a good day for owls, with two Great Horned Owls at the fishdocks and a Barn Owl near the Drake's Beach parking lot. At the lighthouse, some observed Brant's Cormorant; we had great looks at Red-breasted Nuthatch, immature Hermit Warbler, and a Willow Flycatcher. The fishdocks offered looks at Common Murre and Pigeon Guillemot.</p>
    
    In the afternoon we walked part of Estero Trail, then ended the day at Pierce Point Ranch. We saw a coyote and had nice looks at the Tule Elk. We saw quite a few raptors in the afternoon heat, including a very dark morph Red-tailed Hawk. At sunset, the Sharp-shinned Hawks were calling incessantly at the Ranch.

    <p>An overcast day with winds from the northeast gave high hopes of being a premium fallout day, but we had to settle for quality over quantity at Padre Island.  Life looks at the Cape May Warbler at the convention center were enough prize to distract us from a "low" day total.</p><p>Our first trip to the convention center turned up only, ho hum, Blue-winged, Nashville and Tennessee Warblers, 2 orioles, Indigo Bunting and a few other passerines.  We took a break by  going to look at plovers, terns and gulls on the beach behind the convention center itself.  On our return, the Cape May Warbler was spotted almost immediately by the 5 or more photographers with large rigs pointed right at the bird's last known location.</p><p>We stopped at the beach and jetty at the south tip of the island, then said good-bye to South Padre and headed out to Bensen for owls and nightjars.  An elf owl emerged from a known location at 8:14 pm and was quickly joined in a near-by conifer by a second bird.  In the dusk, we observed multiple food exchanges between these two birds before it got too dark to see them at all.  A much more satisfying experience than a simple check-mark on a list.</p>
    <p>Birds observed by others on the trip include: Clapper Rail, Least Sandpiper, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Ladder-backed Woodpecker, Bank Swallow, Cave Swallow, Grey Catbird, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Clay-colored and Savanah Sparrow, Hooded Oriole</p>

    Our most unexpected look of the day was 40 Common Ravens circling on thermals just west of the Hwy 92 summit around 4:00.  I think that's the largest group of ravens I've ever seen.

  notes: |
    This was our big day for the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory's <a href="http://www.sfbbo.org/support/fall_challenge.php">California Fall Challenge</a> (their annual fundraiser). We ran according to standard big day rules. We are entering as "MBB Overdrive" (Mary Wisnewski, Bill Walker, and Bob Power). Our theme this year is "More than a feeling."<br/><br/>
    
    Weather began with clear skies and a temperature of 47 F as we drove over Hwy 92 in the dark.  Skies continued clear with only light wind from the north at the coast.  When we crossed to the bay side, temperature rose nearly 15 degrees to around 85.<br/><br/>
    
    Highlights of the trip as posted to Pen Birds by Bob:<br/><br/>
    
    4 species of Owl in and around Butano State Park and Gazos Cr. Rd.<br/>
    Sooty Sheerwaters on the water and Buller's gliding by at Pigeon Pt.<br/>
    Pacific Loon (1) and Rhino Auklets (3) at Pigeon Pt.<br/>
    Wandering Tattlers (2) under the Pescadero Cr. mouth bridge.<br/>
    Parasitic Jaegers (2) @ Coyote Pt.<br/>
    Black Skimmers (8) at Radio Rd.<br/>
    Blue-winged Teal (2) at Nob Hill pond (Redwood Shores).<br/><br/>
    
    Mary's notes on the route, in case we run it again next year: The route was laid out with two goals:  to catch a migrant flock (which we never really found) and to cover as much habitat diversity as possible. We wrote up a detailed plan with times and our hoped-for target birds at each location.<br/><br/>
    
    Wavecrest - Barn Owl (missed)<br/>
    Pescadero Marsh - rails (missed)<br/>
    Butano State Park - owls<br/>
    Gazos Creek - owls and dawn chorus<br/>
    Gazos Creek Mouth - gulls, shorebirds<br/>
    Pigeon Point - pelagic species and tricolored blackbird<br/>
    Lake Lucerne - stray shorebirds (missed)<br/>
    Pescadero Beach - rocky shorebirds<br/>
    Pillar Point Harbor - divers<br/>
    Princeton Willows - warblers, etc<br/>
    Etheldore (south end) - warblers<br/>
    Skylawn - crossbills (missed)<br/>
    Filoli entrance - oak woodland species<br/>
    Coyote Point - passerine migrants and shorebirds, jaegers<br/>
    Radio Road - ducks, shorebirds, swallows
    Nob Hill Pond - ducks<br/>
    Menlo Park - second chance at a Barn Owl (score!)<br/>
    East PA marsh - for rails and pheasant (missed)<br/>

  notes: This trip supports the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory's annual California Fall Challenge. Mary and Stephanie planned the trip to maximize access to passerine migrants and shorebirds at high tide. Two leaders and eight participants started the day at the West Winton Avenue parking lot for Hayward Regional Shoreline at 8:30am, where five species of warblers and a clay-colored sparrow were seen. The long walk out to Frank's dump gave us a chance to observe Osprey and Horned Larks. Highlights among the shorebirds included Red Knots, Dunlin, and two Snowy Plovers. We then moved south to the Interpretive Center to watch the mudflats as the tide receded, where we saw Semiplamated Plovers, Whimbrels, and nice comparative views of Least and Western Sandpipers. We wrapped up our trip at 2:30pm after two Peregrine Falcons strafed the gull and shorebird flock for several minutes.

    <p>The first day featured long travel itineraries for everybody, but at last we're all here, and starting to realize what a fabulous place this is. </p>
    
    <p>Birding todays started of with a visit to some locations in the town of Leduc while waiting for our last three tour participants to arrive.  Fred Johns Park offered very near views of water birds with chicks: Common Golden-eye, Red-necked Grebe, Bufflehead and American Coots.  Even inside the town we noticed the enormous blue skies of Alberta and the everp-changing cloudscape.</p>
    
    <p>After picking up the rest of our party we made a quick stop at Miquelon Lakes Provincial Park (PP for short) for a quick look at the edge of the woods for warblers. Few turned up, though a Least Flycatcher got us started practicing locating birds by ear.  Two young Great Horned Owls were lurking near the corner of the woods.  A stop at the water's edge produced a Ruddy Duck making a spectacular bubble display as well as two Black Terns and a Spotted Sandpiper. Bird of the day: Black Tern.</p>
    
    <p>Others observed Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Northern Flicker, Black-and-white Warbler, American Redstart, Nashville Warbler</p>

    We started with a drive from Camrose to the Lowden Springs prairie preserve where we saw two Grasshopper sparrows, dozens of Savannah Sparrows and a good five or more Clay-colored Sparrows, along with some good water birds.  The hoped-for Baird's Sparrow and Sprague's pipit were not to be found.  Either it is too late in the summer for them or these target species were observing the Canada Day bank holiday.<br /><br />
    
    We took lunch at the campgrounds in Elnora - possibly the nicest campground restrooms ever - and did a bit of birding in town, then headed out to Dry Island Buffalo Jump provincial park for a last look at grassland habitat on this ten day trip. The canyon of the Red Deer River offers beautiful views of terraced badlands in rich green, grey and brown.  Our wildflower lovers were in awe at the profusion of wildflowers at the top of the buffalo jump overlook.  For me, though the highlight of this stop was a chance to observe a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker pair delivering food to (at least) two nestlings. The female tended to work her insect goodies into a bollus for the chicks and the male made multiple trips without apparently using an anvil to process the insects.  We took in a lot of new information thanks to narration of every detail by woodpecker expert Steve Shunk.<br /><br />
    
    All other birds observed today were spotted on roads between Camrose and our two main destinations.<br /><br />
    
    Species identified by other observers on the trip but missed by us: Marbled Godwit, Eastern Kingbird, Loggerhead Shrike, Common Raven, Violet-green Swallow, Cliff Swallow, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, House Wren, Mountain Bluebird, Spotted Towhee, Lark Sparrow, Baltimore Oriole, and Pine Siskin
