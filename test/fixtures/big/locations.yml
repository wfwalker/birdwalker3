Begin by driving the access road slowly, looking for shorebirds foraging in the marsh next to the road. Sparrows, towhees, thrushes, and some warblers near the parking lot can be fairly cooperative. Walk out on the levee for flight shots of gulls and terns. No entrance fee, Porta potty available. The gate is  often locked in the morning, you can walk in after parking your car off the road."

Morning light tends to be from the side, makind head angle crucial for duck portraits. Active cormorant rookery in the spring makes an interesting feature for landscape shots. Hard to get down to eye level due to steep banks down to the lake. Lake Merritt is in the middle of an urban area, so parking can be tricky."

If lighting permits, be prepared to shoot out both sides of the car, preferably by sitting in back and having someone else drive (thanks, Mary!) Also walk the trees near the parking lots for passerines. Check the trees and ponds near the visitor center, and look for rarity sightings in the notebook inside the visitor center. Bathrooms available. Entrance fee (or buy your federal duck stamp at your local post office)."

  latitude: "37.4573287964"
  notes: |-
    Our second most visited site; location of bill's first birdwalk with Steve Shunk. Includes birds sighted at Lucy Evans Nature Center.
    
    Note to photographers: This site is now most famous for the egret and night-heron rookery located immediately adjacent to the duck pond parking lot. Here in April and May you can get great morning light shots of nesting egrets and night-herons  squabbling over nest sites, sitting on eggs, perched in the palm trees with their chicks, or flying frequently to and from the nest. Be sure to check the duck pond for interesting and highly acclimated ducks and gulls -- with a 500mm you can get some great portraits here. Be sure to check the trees around the pond for passerines and raptors.

    Note to photographers: This site in a deep canyon affords little direct light in the morning, but does offer an interesting variety of passerines visiting the feeders at the Audubon society office or the community garden plots. Choose your angles carefully to deliberately include or exclude manmade perches and backgrounds.

It's tempting to chase your target birds up and down the shore, but I find its more productive to be quiet and stationary and let the birds drift toward you as they forage. Check the trees for Red-tailed Hawks. This can also be a good spot for sparrows and some shorebirds. There is a booth at the entrance to the park, but I have never paid a fee there. Bathrooms available. Parking can be crowded on the weekends."

You will find good morning light and some acclimated and cooperative woodpeckers and various passerines. At midday it is possible to find shaded subjects against shaded backgrounds if you work at it. No entrance fee. Parking can be difficult on the weekends. Bathrooms provided. The park is officially open from 8am until shortly after sunset, but in practice the gate is often opened earlier in the morning."

  notes: "Note to photographers: The pond between the dog park and the sewage treatment plant can be a great place for end-of-day shorebird shots as the sun is going down. A slow and stealthy approach can allow you a pretty close, low angle shot of dowitchers and sandpipers. Flights of terns, ducks, shorebirds, and even skimmers are also possible. The dog park might have a porta potty. No entrance fee. "
